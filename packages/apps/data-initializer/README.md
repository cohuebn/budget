# Database initializer

The database initializer allows setting up the budget databases in a ready-to-use state.
This includes:

1. Ensuring any expected collections, indices, etc. are in-place in our MongoDB instance
2. Ensuring any expected users are in-place in our Firebase and MongoDB instances
